NYS Department of Health Standards

Prices of Medical Marijuana Products:

The Compassionate Care Act requires that the Department set the price of medical marijuana products. The Commissioner must set the price per dose of each form of medical marijuana sold by the registered organizations, and must take into account the fixed and variable costs of producing the form of marijuana in approving such price. The Department is actively working on the pricing process. The Department will review proposed prices submitted by the registered organizations and may approve, deny or modify proposed prices per 10 NYCRR ยง 1004.15(c)(4).


Product Quality

To protect the public's health and safety, registered organizations must meet high product quality standards in New York State. Final products must be tested for their cannabinoid profile, as well as for various contaminants and pesticides.

Until such time as independent laboratories are certified in New York State to test medical marijuana products, the Department of Health's Wadsworth Laboratories is conducting the final product testing. The regulations require that the testing of each lot of final medical marijuana product be conducted with a statistically significant number of samples using acceptable methodologies to ensure that all lots manufactured of each medical marijuana product are adequately assessed for contaminants and the cannabinoid profile is consistent throughout.


Allowed Products

Registered organizations in New York State will be manufacturing medical marijuana products that will be available in the following dosage forms, approved in regulation:

liquid or oil preparations for metered oromucosal or sublingual administration or administration per tube;
metered liquid or oil preparations for vaporization;
capsules for oral administration;
any additional form and route of administration approved by the commissioner.

Smoking as a method of administration is prohibited by the Compassionate Care Act. Edible products are also not permitted.
